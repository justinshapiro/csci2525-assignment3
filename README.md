##Assignment 4##
Filename: RandomString.asm
Create a procedure (UserInt) that asks for an integer input from a user. The
procedure must pass this integer back to the calling program as an argument. DO
NOT use a global label.
Create a procedure (RandStr) that generates a string of length (L = 30), containing
random capital letters. When calling the procedure, pass the value of L in EAX,
and pass a pointer to an array of byte which will hold the string.
Write a program that uses both procedures where the input from the user
determines how many times to generate a random string (not the same one over
and over).
1. The output will be shown in the console window one string per line.
2. You may use any command Chapter 5 and below.
3. Your procedure must be called from the main procedure.
4. Part of the program will be graded on the basis of program style. I reserve the
right to judge style as I deem fit for the assignment. The use of comments is
required and not optional.
5. Upload to Canvas prior to the due date.
ExtraCredit: Print each string in a random color.
